# Changelog

## 2.0.0

- Upgrade to Dart 2
- Use BigInt (found in `dart:core`) instead of `package:bignum`. This
  affects return values as well (factorial) so we're bumping major semver
  of this package to 2.0.

## 1.1.2

- Upgrade to latest
- Make the dependency to `bignum` a runtime dependency (instead of
  a dev dependency) 

## 0.0.1
